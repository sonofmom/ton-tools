## Overview
This repository contains collection of helpful tools for TON Network.

## Requirements
Python scripts require `pyTON` and `tvm-valuetypes` libraries. 

## Node related 
Those scripts are helpful for anyone who wishes to operate a TON Node. Located under `/node` path:

#### IP Conversion
* `dec2ip.py` will convert decimal IP address representation into IPV4 format. 
* `ip2dec.py` will convert decimal IPV4 IP address into decimal format.

Both scripts will properly convert to and from negative decimals to be used in node configuration.

#### Key files conversion
* `key2b64.py` will convert key file to base64 representation for later usage in config files.

#### Config generators
* `mkcontrol.sh`: Generates JSON structure for validator / node console needed for node `config.json` file
* `mklite.sh`: Generates JSON structure for lite server listener needed for node `config.json` file
* `mkpub_dht.sh`: Generates JSON structure that can be used as server definition in network configuration files, requires presence of `generate-random-id` in path. 

#### Services
Here you can find example control scripts for services, at the moment daemontools `run` files to control node as well as dht server.

Node `run` script is tuned to run more then one instance of full node / validator per host. This will probably not be needed in live environment but was/is very handy in test setups.

## Sites
#### ADNL Query
* `adnl_resolve.py` will query DHT servers and attempt to resolve ADNL address to IP and Port, requires presence of dht-resolve binary which can be build from TON source tree (`dht-resolve` target).

## Wallet
#### Parsing
* `parse_addr.py` will parse addr file and return address information in human readable format or json structure. Start without parameters to see usage instructions.
